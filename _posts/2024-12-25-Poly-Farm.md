## Machinations

I stumbled across [Machinations.io](https://machinations.io/) recently while I was looking up ways to visualize game systems for systems designers. It's a neat tool.

In this post I'll be exploring how I used it to visualize a mechanic in a gacha game I enjoy playing, *Epic Seven*.

## The Gear Enhancement Mechanic

![Epic Seven and Genshin Impact example](https://isaacwkm.github.io/assets/images/2024-12-08-Machinations/epicSevenGenshinComparison.png)
*Pictured: A common theme in equipment enhancement across gacha titles. Equipment usually have a single-most "desired stat" (highlighted in the small red box), alongside other less-desired stats.*

Gacha / JRPG genres often employ a random stat distribution to player equipment as they enhance them. Diagrams help visualize how likely a player will achieve their gear-related goals in their playtime.

Gacha games drop a LOT of gear to the player. It's up to the player to decide what they want and sift through their gear to see if they have something worth keeping.

Sometimes, you'll find an item that fits just the stat profile of what you're looking for. When that happens, you enhance it, which upgrades its level and incrases a random substat. This is an infamous source of randomness present in many gacha titles, and players often don't get their items to enhance the stats they want.

As such, you can imagine how hard it would be to have multiple random rolls land on the same stat multiple times in a row, much like betting red on roulette 10 times in a row.

If you want to make your own Machinations, check out their site. I made this Machination with the free plan staying just under 50 components.

## Conclusion

Gacha games make a LOT of money. While their business models are controversial, gacha games know how to make a game system you can't stop coming back to. These games have engineered the essence of game systems design and I like to find inspiration in these systems that are carefully designed so. The system I covered in this post was a surface-level introduction to Machinations but systems get more interesting once you dive deeper.
