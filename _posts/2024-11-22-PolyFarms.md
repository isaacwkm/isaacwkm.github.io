*Poly Farms was created as a group, as part of one of our university's (University of California: Santa Cruz) capstone projects. I coded the game systems and animations involving the day cycle, background props, and plant growth coupling with game logic.*

## Reflection

This project was a great experience at getting used to working on Unity projects in teams, and as well highlighting the difference in convenience and skillsets needed for each platform. Unity trivialized a lot of coding challenges through its editor tools, while the Javascript project required us to focus more on effecient data handling and elegant system design.
