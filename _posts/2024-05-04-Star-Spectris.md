## Conclusion

Gacha games make a LOT of money. While their business models are controversial, gacha games know how to make a game system you can't stop coming back to. These games have engineered the essence of game systems design and I like to find inspiration in these systems that are carefully designed so. The system I covered in this post was a surface-level introduction to Machinations but systems get more interesting once you dive deeper.
