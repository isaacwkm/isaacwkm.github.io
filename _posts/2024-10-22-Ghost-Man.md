*Ghost-Man was created as a group, as part of one of our university's (University of California: Santa Cruz) capstone projects. I designed the level and led the art production of the characters and playing stage.*

## Conclusion

Ghost-Man was a fun group project that taught me more about working in Unity. Working with more experienced programmers in this project set me up to eventually lead the <i>Poly Farms</i> project on my own. This project was invaluable to me as I distinctly remember one of the lead programmers referring to me as "the art guy", which as flattering as it was, also hurt a little as I wanted to be more useful as a programmer. Working on the sidelines and asking questions to the lead programmers helped learn a lot about working in Unity. Thanks to Connor Lowe and Jaime McCann for your patience!
