*Ghost-Man was created as a group, as part of one of our university's (University of California: Santa Cruz) capstone projects. I designed the level and led the art production of the characters and playing stage.*

## Shot Breakdowns

![Tiled Preview](https://isaacwkm.github.io/assets/images/2024-12-26-Ghost-Man/tiledPreview.png)

*The stage of Ghost-Man without most of its visual elements.*

• <strong>The map was made in Tiled using tilesets provided by Kenney Assets</strong>

• <strong>Tiles were hand-placed by myself onto the tilemap to create a haunted mansion stage</strong>

• <strong>Collision objects were separated from cosmetic objects using layers</strong>

*The stage of Ghost-Man highlighting its mechanical parts (collision with the player).*

• <strong>The map was exported to Unity2D to be used as the playing stage</strong>

• <strong>Setting collision boxes was made trivial due to layers being previously set in Tiled</strong>

*Pre-planning brainstorm notes before game development.*

## The EMF Reader

*The EMF reader and character animation states were drawn in Aseprite.*

The EMF reader is a gadget visible on the bottom-left corner of the screen. It keeps track of nearby ghosts and beeps at red when ghosts are very close-by.

## Conclusion

Ghost-Man was a fun group project that taught me more about working in Unity. Working with more experienced programmers in this project set me up to eventually lead the <i>Poly Farms</i> project on my own. This project was invaluable to me as I distinctly remember one of the lead programmers referring to me as "the art guy", which as flattering as it was, also hurt a little as I wanted to be more useful as a programmer. Working on the sidelines and asking questions to the lead programmers helped learn a lot about working in Unity. Thanks to Connor Lowe and Jaime McCann for your patience!
